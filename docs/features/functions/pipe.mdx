Pipe functions show up as their own model in the workspace. 
They are used to perform actions prior to returning LLM messages to the user.
Examples of potential actions you can take with Pipes  
- Advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Sending requests to non-OpenAI LLM providers (such as Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, or Google)
- Executing functions right in your web UI.
