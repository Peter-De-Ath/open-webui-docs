# Functions

Functions are used to perform actions in Open WebUI. They can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, the are currently 3 types of functions:
    - Actions
    - Filters
    - Pipes

See our other project [Pipelines](https://github.com/open-webui/pipelines) for more examples of functions (advanced).


## Function Formatting

The following fields are required for a function to be recognized by Open WebUI:
    - `title`: The title of the function.
    - `author`: The author of the function.
    - `author_url`: The URL of the author's website or GitHub profile.
    - `funding_url`: The URL of the author's funding page.
    - `version`: The version of the function.
    - `icon_url`: The URL of the function's icon. (this can also be a base64 encoded image)
    - `required_open_webui_version`: The minimum version of Open WebUI required to run the function.


# Event Emitter

The Event Emitter function allows you to emit events to the client. This can be useful for sending messages to the client, such as progress on long running tasks.

You can use the `__event_emitter__` function to emit an event to the client. The event type and data are passed as arguments to the function.

## Status Updates

Example usage
```python
await __event_emitter__(
                {
                    "type": "status",
                    "data": {"description": "Running the task", "done": False},
                }
            )

# do some other work

await __event_emitter__(
                {
                    "type": "status",
                    "data": {"description": "Task complete", "done": True},
                }
            )
```
