# Functions

In the context of the provided code snippets, the terms "Pipe", "Filter", and "Action" can be understood as different components of a processing system that handles data flow.

1. **Filter**: 
   - A filter typically serves the purpose of modifying or validating input data before it is processed further. In the provided code, both the `Filter` classes in `charts.py` and `auto_memories.py` seem to represent filter functionalities that likely deal with the manipulation and validation of incoming data. The `inlet` method in both classes is designed to process the request body, allowing for checks and modifications before passing the data along to another system or API.

2. **Pipe**: 
   - While there isn't a direct representation of a "Pipe" in the provided code, generally, a pipe would be a mechanism to connect multiple filters (or other processing functions) in a sequence, where the output of one becomes the input of the next. This concept is often used in data processing to streamline operations and facilitate the flow of data through various transformations.

3. **Action**: 
   - An action typically refers to a function or method that performs a specific task resulting in some change in state or behavior, such as updating a database or sending a request to an API. In this context, action functions may not be explicitly detailed in your provided snippets but would follow the filtering steps, performing operations based on the filtered data.

In summary, filters are responsible for validating and modifying data, pipes manage the flow between these filters, and actions execute tasks based on the processed data. To get more information about how these concepts are implemented in the specific context of your project, you may want to look into the documentation that explains the overall architecture of your application or check for additional modules or classes that define "Pipe" and "Action".

Functions are used to perform actions in Open WebUI. They can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, the are currently 3 types of functions:
    - Actions
    - Filters
    - Pipes

See our other project [Pipelines](https://github.com/open-webui/pipelines) for more examples of functions (advanced).


## Function Formatting

```
"""
title: Custom Action
author: open-webui
author_url: https://github.com/open-webui
funding_url: https://github.com/open-webui

```

The following fields are required for a function to be recognized by Open WebUI:
    - `title`: The title of the function.
    - `author`: The author of the function.
    - `author_url`: The URL of the author's website or GitHub profile.
    - `funding_url`: The URL of the author's funding page.
    - `version`: The version of the function.
    - `icon_url`: The URL of the function's icon. (this can also be a base64 encoded image)
    - `required_open_webui_version`: The minimum version of Open WebUI required to run the function.


# Event Emitter

The Event Emitter function allows you to emit events to the client. This can be useful for sending messages to the client, such as progress on long running tasks.

You can use the `__event_emitter__` function to emit an event to the client. The event type and data are passed as arguments to the function.

## Status Updates

Example usage
```python
await __event_emitter__(
                {
                    "type": "status",
                    "data": {"description": "Running the task", "done": False},
                }
            )

# do some other work

await __event_emitter__(
                {
                    "type": "status",
                    "data": {"description": "Task complete", "done": True},
                }
            )
```
