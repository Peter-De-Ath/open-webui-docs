# Filters

Filter Functions have 2 main components:
- Inlet: Incoming user messages before they are sent to the model.
- Outlet: Outgoing assistant messages before they are sent to the user.

Filters can be used to perform actions against incoming user messages (inlet) and outgoing (outlet) assistant messages. 
Potential actions that can be taken in a filter include 
- sending messages to monitoring platforms (such as Langfuse or DataDog)
- modifying message contents
- blocking toxic messages
- translating messages to another language
- rate limiting messages from certain users. 

Checkout some examples on the [Community](https://openwebui.com/functions) with the `Filter` tag.

After importing or creating a filter in Open WebUI, you will need to enable it.
To do this go to Workspace -> Functions -> Toggle the filter you want to enable.
    - You can mark a filter as global to apply it to all models.
    - Alternatively you can apply a filter to a specific model selecting the filter in the model settings. Workspace -> Models -> Select the model -> Filters -> Select the filter/s you want to apply.
